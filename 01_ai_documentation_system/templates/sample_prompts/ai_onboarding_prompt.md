## üéØ **AI Onboarding Prompt**

```
Hi! I'm bringing you into an ongoing project. I've set up a comprehensive documentation system to help you understand everything quickly.

**Project**: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
**My Role**: {{YOUR_ROLE}} (e.g., "Lead Developer", "Project Manager", "Solo Developer")
**Your Role**: {{AI_ROLE}} (e.g., "Coding Assistant", "Architecture Advisor", "Code Reviewer")

## üìö **Please Read These Files First (in order):**

1. **docs/README.md** - Start here for navigation
2. **docs/00_context/project_overview.md** - What we're building
3. **docs/00_context/current_status.md** - Where we are now
4. **{{CURSORRULES_PATH}}** - Coding standards and preferences

**Total reading time**: ~5 minutes

## üéØ **What I Need You To Do:**

After reading, please:
1. **Confirm Understanding**: Summarize the project in 2-3 sentences
2. **Identify Current Focus**: What should we work on next?
3. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: What's unclear or needs more context?
4. **Suggest Next Steps**: Based on current status, what are logical next actions?

## üîß **Working Style Preferences:**

- **Communication**: {{COMMUNICATION_STYLE}} (e.g., "Direct and concise", "Detailed explanations", "Step-by-step guidance")
- **Code Style**: Follow the .cursorrules file exactly
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs when making changes
- **Decision Making**: {{DECISION_STYLE}} (e.g., "Ask before major changes", "Proceed with best practices", "Explain options and let me choose")

## üìã **Current Session Goals:**

{{CURRENT_SESSION_GOALS}}
<!-- Example:
- Set up development environment
- Create basic project structure  
- Implement first core feature
- Review and improve documentation
-->

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**

- **Always read current_status.md first** when starting a new session
- **Update documentation** as we make progress
- **Ask questions** if anything is unclear
- **Follow the established process** outlined in the guides

Ready to start? Please confirm you've read the files and understand the project context.

## üìä **Success Metrics**

A successful onboarding should result in:
- [ ] AI understands project context in <5 minutes
- [ ] AI provides relevant, actionable suggestions
- [ ] AI follows established coding standards
- [ ] AI updates documentation appropriately
- [ ] AI asks good clarifying questions

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **If AI seems confused:**
1. Check if it actually read the files
2. Provide more specific context
3. Break down the request into smaller parts
4. Reference specific sections of documentation

### **If AI ignores standards:**
1. Explicitly reference .cursorrules
2. Provide examples of expected output
3. Correct immediately and explain why
4. Update documentation if standards unclear
